/**
 * This class represents a section within a configuration
 * file.
 *
 * <p>Policies:</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Keys:</strong> Keys are Strings which are the
 * name of the value stored at them. Keys can contain
 * periods if the value is stored inside of a child config
 * section. For example, the key {@code sec1.sec2.key} leads
 * to:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *  {
 *      "comment": "The key for this is simply comment",
 *      "sec1": {
 *          "comment": "The key for this is sec1.comment",
 *          "sec2": {
 *              "comment": "The key for this is sec1.sec2.key",
 *              "key": "value"
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Get value:</strong> Obtains the value at the
 * given key. A key that does not exist <b>NEVER</b> returns
 * {@code null} or a default value, but throws a
 * {@link RuntimeException}.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Set value:</strong> Sets the value at the key.
 * This ignores any previous value and simply replaces the
 * value if the key already exists, or creates the key if
 * it does not already.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Committing changes:</strong> Changes are
 * never eagerly committed. Instead, the root config section
 * (always the {@link JsonConfig} object) needs to be saved in
 * order for any changes to be written. Returned values from
 * getXYZ methods also must be {@link #set(String, Object)}
 * before changes take effect. It is up to the
 * implementation on whether to commit changes
 * eagerly.</p>
